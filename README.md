# Personal Task Tracker


## Description

Personal Task Tracker is a user-friendly web application designed to help you manage your daily tasks efficiently. With this app, you can easily add new tasks by providing a title and description, mark tasks as complete or incomplete, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks you no longer need. The app also allows you to filter your tasks based on their status—showing all tasks, only completed tasks, or only incomplete tasks—so you can focus on what matters most.

All your tasks are securely stored in your browser using the localStorage API, ensuring your data remains private and available even after refreshing or closing the browser. The intuitive interface makes it simple to keep track of your to-dos, stay organized, and boost your productivity every day.
